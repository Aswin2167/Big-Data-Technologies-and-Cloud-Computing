        "\n",
        "*   **Volume:** The sheer volume of big data exceeds the storage and memory capacity of a single machine. Distributing data across multiple machines (scalable storage) is essential.\n",
        "*   **Velocity:** The high velocity of big data streams requires processing data as it arrives, which is often too fast for sequential processing on a single machine. Parallel computing allows data to be processed concurrently across multiple nodes, keeping up with the data flow.\n",
        "*   **Variety:** The diverse formats and structures of big data make it challenging to store and process using traditional, rigid database schemas. Distributed systems and flexible data models are needed to handle this variety.\n",
        "*   **Processing Time:** Analyzing petabytes or exabytes of data on a single machine would take an unfeasibly long time. Parallel processing divides the computational workload across many machines, significantly reducing processing time.\n",

        "*   **Spark:** A fast and general-purpose engine for large-scale data processing. Spark can run on top of HDFS or other storage systems and offers significant performance advantages over MapReduce, especially for iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis. It provides APIs in multiple languages (Java, Scala, Python, R).\n",
